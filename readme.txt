In addition to the README.md on the github page, here is a summary of what’s working and not working and where we ended up.

APP SUMMARY
This is an made to help new students navigate new student week. our main view is the schedule view, where you can swipe left and right to go between days, or tap an event to see it’s details. On the detail page, you have the option to set a notification.  You can also access a google maps view of carleton’s campus. There are sections for important contacts where you can tap a number to call, and a section for Carleton-specific acronyms

WHATS WORKING
As far as we know, the event list view is working, the map is working, and all navigation and core features are working. 

WHATS NOT WORKING
A few things we didn’t finish were a tap-to-email option on the Important Contacts page. We also struggled with getting the event detail view to be scrollable, so the content on that page might appear squished together to fit on the screen. 

GETTING STARTED
If for some reason the google maps framework files are importing correctly. follow the instructions on this page: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/start. More than likely you will not need to however.
