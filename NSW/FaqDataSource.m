However, for courses designated “sophomore priority,” sophomores register first, then first-year students, then seniors, and lastly juniors. Within each class, students register three times a year and are assigned three registration priority numbers, one for each trimester. Each student’s numbers add up to 42.Practically speaking, this means you can’t always get into a course you want during the term you want to take it. When you have a “good” registration number, use it! You’ll soon learn which classes fill up quickly. If you have questions, your Liberal Arts Adviser, Resident Assistant (RA), or a student departmental adviser (SDA) can help you figure out how to strategize. Do keep in mind though that not all courses are offered every term.";

Academic advisers for First- and Second-Year students are called \"Liberal Arts Advisers\" (whereas advisers for Juniors and Seniors are called \"Major Advisers\").  Liberal Arts Advisers coordinate course selection, discuss educational and career goals, and encourage students to consider questions of personal growth. Advisers also aid in planning academic programs and in referring students to other campus services. Students are responsible for pursuing this process as they deem appropriate for their needs; effective advising is only possible when communication yields an exchange of ideas. First- and second-year Liberal Arts Advisers are assigned generally; that is, a student thinking of majoring in studio art might have a mathematician as an adviser, or an aspiring chemist may be advised by an English professor. This is not a problem. In addition to your Liberal Arts Adviser, department chairs are available to meet with students during New Student Week and throughout the year. RAs, New Student Week Leaders (NSWLs), and Student Department Assistants (SDAs) are also available during New Student Week and beyond.

Almost all students who have not fulfilled the language requirement enroll in a language class sometime during their first year. If you place into Spanish 103, for instance, you'll wait until spring term to enroll. If you decide to start Japanese, you'll want to enroll your first term. What else?

Quantitative Reasoning requires three courses designated as a “Quantitatively Rich Encounter.” Writing requirements require you to take a first-year \"Argument and Inquiry\" seminar, an additional six credit writing course, and submit a revised writing portfolio the spring of your sophomore year.

Students generally enroll in only three six-credit courses each term (credits for participating in music and drama activities are extra). You register three times a year, changing courses each term after talking with your adviser. What does this mean in practical terms? For one thing, while students at semester schools have to fit their course work into eight terms over four years, Carleton students have twelve terms. A student planning to major in chemistry at a semester school probably needs to start chemistry the first term of the first year—the second semester at the latest—or the student will run into trouble fitting in all the requirements. Because you have twelve terms at Carleton, you can enter a major a bit later; in fact, Carleton students don't declare majors until the end of the sophomore year.

Off-campus seminars led by Carleton faculty are available in Chinese, French, German, Russian and Spanish. Carleton students may also enroll in programs offered by other institutions or by consortia of which Carleton is a member. A number of competitive Carleton fellowships provide additional opportunities for internships, research or service learning abroad. \n\n Interest in the literature, history, politics, or culture: Obviously, advanced study of the literature, history, politics or culture of a particular country or region requires proficiency in a language. Students are often surprised to learn that many graduate programs, especially in the humanities, require a reading knowledge of French, German or other languages, no matter what their area of specialization. \n\n Local immigrant populations:  Nearly 1 in 5 Americans speaks a language other than English at home. Spanish is the most common, followed by Chinese, French, German, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Italian, Korean, Russian and Polish. [Source: 2000 Census] Knowing another language can give you access to the cultural riches of immigrant communities, while opening up opportunities in business and volunteer service. \n\n Family background: Learning the language of your forebears can open lines of communication with non-English-speaking relatives, while deepening your understanding of your family’s roots. \n\n Sharpening intellectual skills: Learning a second language helps improve memory, critical thinking and study skills.
