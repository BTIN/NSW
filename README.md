===
*An application for Carleton's New Student Week*

Note: Make sure to open ```NSW.xcworkspace``` **not** ```NSW.xcodeproj```, otherwise the app won't build

Done:
---
- Mostly complete ```Event``` and ```Contact``` models
- Stubs of Event and Contact DataSources
- Stubs of Event, Contact, and Map UIs
- Tab bar navigation between various screens

To-Do:
---
- ```DictionaryWord``` model, DataSource, and UI (waiting on Web Services to agree on data format)
- Introduce ```MMDrawerController``` in place of ```UITabBarController``` (more complex than just that)
- Flesh out existing classes
- Implement actual UI style standards to match mockups
- Write tests
